Java implementation of Tic Tac Toe using Java Swing. You can play against computer, but the best outcome you can get is draw. <br />
This program (AI) uses [minimax algorithm](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/2013/12/13/tic-tac-toe-understanding-the-minimax-algorithm13/) for deciding which move to play. The game tree of Tic tac toe isn't that big, so every move program can calculate fast enough the whole tree, so it play the best possible move.
